ERROR! the role 'node_exporter' was not found in /home/prometheus/Monitoring-Prometheus/playbooks/roles:/home/prometheus/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles:/home/prometheus/Monitoring-Prometheus/playbooks

The error appears to be in '/home/prometheus/Monitoring-Prometheus/playbooks/monitoring.yml': line 4, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  roles:
    - node_exporter
      ^ here
